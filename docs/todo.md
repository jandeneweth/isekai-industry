# TODO

- Remove tons of vanilla journal entries (and ideally also events...)
- Have natural state modifiers multiply infrastructure, instead of flat adding
- Investigate colonization of Russian far eastern states: broken due to overlapping borders?
- Separate subject type for start-date tributaries, or at least disconnected from up/down grade of vassals
