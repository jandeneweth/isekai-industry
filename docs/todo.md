# TODO

- Remove tons of vanilla journal entries (and ideally also events...)
- Try to rewrite on_actions for better compatibility (see https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/threads/on_actions.1572579/)
- Investigate colonization of Russian far eastern states: broken due to overlapping borders?
- Separate subject type for start-date tributaries, or at least disconnected from up/down grade of vassals
- Have natural state modifiers multiply infrastructure, instead of flat adding
- Tweak construction (halve resources used, increase construction output more gradually - more at low level?)
